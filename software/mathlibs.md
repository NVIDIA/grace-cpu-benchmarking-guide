# Math Libraries on Arm64

TBD

Many math libraries support Arm64 CPUs.  In many cases, open source math libraries like BLIS, OpenBLAS, FFTW, etc. can be substituted for libraries that have not yet announced support for Arm64 (e.g. Intel MKL).  Arm community members like NVIDIA, AWS, and Oracle are actively contributing to enabling Arm64 support wherever possible.

## GPU Math Libraries

All NVIDIA GPU math libraries work perfectly on Arm-hosted GPUs. In this case, the architecture of the host CPU is irrelevant.  If your application uses GPU-accelerated math libraries, proceed exactly as you would on any other platform.

## Single-node Math Libraries

## Multi-node Math Libraries
