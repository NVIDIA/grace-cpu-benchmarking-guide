# GAP Benchmark Suite: BFS

The [GAP Benchmark Suite (Beamer, 2015)][1] was released with the goal of helping standardize graph processing evaluations. Graph algorithms and their applications are currently gaining renewed interest, especially with the growth of social networks and their analysis. Graph algorithms are also important for their applications in science and recognition. The GAP benchmark suite builds upon the [graph500](https://graph500.org/) competition by providing substantially higher performance reference code and provides a standard for graph processing evaluations. 

Even though GAP benchmark suite provides real world graphs and more than one kernel, we will only look at what the graph500 competition looks at but from the GAP benchmarking suite perspective, i.e., using synthetic Kronecker graphs and focusing on the Breadth First Search (BFS) kernel.  

## Initial Configuration

The repo here is the reference implementation for the [GAP Benchmark Suite](http://gap.cs.berkeley.edu/). It is designed to be a portable high-performance baseline that only requires a compiler with support for C++11. It uses OpenMP for parallelism, but it can be compiled without OpenMP to run serially. The details of the benchmark can be found in the [specification][1].

## Quick Start

Clone the reference code from the [github](https://github.com/sbeamer/gapbs) repo and follow the following steps to build from source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sbeamer/gapbs.git 
cd gapbs
make
```

In case you want to override the default C++ compiler and build with an older version:
```bash
CXX=g++-8 make
```

Run BFS kernel on 1024 vertices for 1 iteration:
```bash
./bfs -g 10 -n 1
```
Additional command line flags can be found with `-h`.

## Running the BFS kernel

After successfully building and running a test run, you should be ready to run the bfs kernel.

**Note**: The command line options of interest here are:
* `-g <scale>`: generate Kronecker graph with 2^scale vertices (Graph500 specifications)
* `-k <degree>`: average degree for synthetic graph (default value: 16) (Graph500 specifications)
* `-n <n>`: perform n trials (default value: 16)

Typically, we select a scale such that the working dataset size for the workload lies outside the Last level cache on the test platforms.

A scale value of 26 means our graph will have ~67.11 M vertices. This size of graph should be large enough so that the working set of the workload will not completely lie within the last level cache of the Grace CPU. 

The default value for average degree is chosen i.e., 16. And to emulate the reference code from the graph500 competition, we will choose 64 trials, i.e. -n value of 64.

Run bfs with the following command:
```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=72 OMP_PROC_BIND=close numactl -m 0 -C 0-71 ./bfs -g 26 -k 16 -n 64
```
This command will pin our application to CPU socket 0 and physical cores 0-71. 

## Output

When you run bfs on a Kronecker graph of scale 26 and degree 16, you should see Average Time around 0.0395 Â± 0.001 ms as shown in the figure below.
