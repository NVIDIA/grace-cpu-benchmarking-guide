# How to Use This Guide

This guide includes procedures, sample code, recommendations, and technical best practices to achieve optimal performance for key benchmarks and applications (workloads) that run on the [NVIDIA® Grace CPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/). By following the instructions in this guide, you should be able to replicate the published Grace CPU performance numbers and execute a fair and informative competitive analysis of the Grace CPU.

## Navigation

Use the menu in the left pane to quickly navigate through the guide. The guide is divided into the following sections:

* [Platform Configuration](platform.md): This section helps you tune your system for benchmarking. The instructions will help optimize the platform conﬁguration.
* [Foundational Benchmarks](foundations/index.md): After checking the platform conﬁguration, this section helps you complete a [sanity check](foundations/index.md) and conﬁrm that the system is healthy.
* [Common Benchmarks](benchmarks/index.md): This section has information about the industry-recognized benchmarks and mini-apps that represent the performance of key workloads.
* [Applications](applications/index.md): This section has information about maximizing the performance of full applications. 
* [Developer Best Practices](developer/index.md): This section has general best practices information to develop for NVIDIA Grace.

The sections can be read in any order, but we strongly recommend you begin by [tuning](platform.md) and [sanity checking](foundations/index.md) your platform.
