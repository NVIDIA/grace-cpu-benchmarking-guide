# Foundations

Foundational benchmarks stress a particular aspect of the system to confirm that it is operating as expected.
These benchmarks do not represent any one application or problem area.  Rather, they are execellent sanity
checks for the system and can produce simple, comparable numbers with minimal configuration.

We strongly recommend running all foundational benchmarks before performing any competitive analysis.
These benchmarks are simple and execute quickly, so we advise you repeat them every time you benchmark.
