# Foundational Benchmarks

Foundational benchmarks confirm whether the system operating as expected. These benchmarks do not represent one application or problem area. They are excellent sanity checks for the system and can produce simple, comparable numbers with minimal configuration.

Before performing any competitive analysis, we strongly recommend that you run all foundational benchmarks. These benchmarks are simple and execute quickly, so you should repeat them every time you benchmark.
