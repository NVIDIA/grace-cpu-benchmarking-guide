# How to Use This Guide

This guide includes how-to guides, sample code, recommendations, and technical best practices to help achieve optimal performance for key benchmarks and applications (workloads) running on the [NVIDIA Grace CPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu/).  By following the instructions given here, you should be able to replicate published Grace CPU performance numbers and execute a fair and informative competitive analysis of the Grace CPU.

## Navigation

Use the menu in the sidebar to navigate quickly through the guide.  The guide is divided into sections: 

* [Platform Configuration](platform.md): Begin by tuning your system for benchmarking.  These quick start instructions help optimize the platform configuration.
* [Foundational Benchmarks](foundations/README.md): After checking the platform configuration, [sanity check](foundations/README.md) to confirm the system is healthy and well-tuned.
* [Common Benchmarks](benchmarks/README.md): Industry-recognized benchmarks and miniapps that represent the performance of key workloads.
* [Applications](applications/README.md): Guides for maximizing the performance of full applications.
* [Developer Best Practices](developer/README.md): General best practices for developing for NVIDIA Grace.

The sections can be read in any order, but we strongly recommend you begin by [tuning](platform.md) and [sanity checking](foundations/README.md) your platform.
