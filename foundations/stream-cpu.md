## Initial Configuration
STREAM is a defacto standard for measuring memory bandwidth.
The benchmark includes four kernels that operate on 1D arrays `a`, `b`, and `c`, with scalar `x`: 
 * **COPY**: `c = a`
 * **SCALE**: `b = x*a`
 * **ADD**: `c = a + b`
 * **TRIAD**: `a = b + x*c`

The kernels are executed in sequence in a loop.  Two parameters configure STREAM:
 * `STREAM_ARRAY_SIZE`: The number of double-precision elements in each array.
   It is critical to select a sufficiently large array size when measuring 
   bandwidth to/from main memory.
 * `NTIMES`: The number of iterations of the test loop.

There are many versions of STREAM, but they all use the same four fundamental kernels.  For simplicity we recommend you use this version: https://github.com/jlinford/stream.  This implementation is restructured to demonstrate the performance benefits of OpenMP,
effective use of NUMA, and features of the Arm architecture.  It uses a version of
stream that has been modified to enable dynamic memory allocation and to separate 
the kernel implementation from the benchmark driver.  This makes it the code easier
to read and faciliatates the use of external tools to measure the performance in 
each kernel.

```bash
# Clone the repo
cd $HOME/benchmarks
git clone https://github.com/jlinford/stream.git
# That's it!
```

The Makefile for https://github.com/jlinford/stream uses the `COMPILER` variable to select good default flags for various compilers.  At the time of this writing, GCC, NVIDIA, ACfL, and Futjisu compilers are supported.

## NVIDIA HPC SDK

To build with the NVIDIA compilers and run with OpenMP:

```bash
cd $HOME/benchmarks/stream
make clean run COMPILER=nvidia 
```
