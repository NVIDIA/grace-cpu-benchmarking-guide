# Language-specific Considerations
Applications built using interpreted or JIT'd languages (Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, etc.) should run as-is. This guide contains language specific sections with recommendations e.g. [Java](java.md) and [Python](python.md). If there is no language specific section, it is because there is no specific guidance beyond using a suitably current version of the language.  Simply proceed as you would on any other CPUs, Arm-based or otherwise.

Applications using compiled languages including C, C++ or Go, need to be compiled for the Arm64 architecture. Most modern builds (e.g. using Make) will just work when run natively on Arm64.  Youâ€™ll find language specific compiler recommendations in this repository: [C/C++](c-c++.md), [Go](golang.md), and [Rust](rust.md).  Again , if there is no specific guidance it's because everything works _exactly_ the same on Arm64 as on other platforms.
